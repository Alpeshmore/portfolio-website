        <p>I'm Alpesh Ajit More, a passionate Python developer and a student at Pimpri Chinchwad University. I specialize in building efficient, scalable, and innovative solutions using Python. Whether it's web development, automation, data analysis, or backend engineering, I love solving real-world problems with clean and efficient code.

            As a student, Iâ€™m constantly learning and exploring new technologies to stay ahead in the ever-evolving tech landscape. I thrive on challenges and enjoy working on projects that push the boundaries of my skills.
            
            When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the latest tech trends, working on side projects, or collaborating with like-minded developers.</p>

            <h3><a href="p3.html" class="Name">MNIST Digit Recognition with Neural Network and Webcam</a></h3>
            <p>This project focuses on developing a deep learning model using TensorFlow and Keras to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The model is trained to classify digits (0-9) and is then integrated with a webcam to enable real-time digit recognition. Using OpenCV, the system captures images, preprocesses them, and predicts the handwritten digit using the trained neural network. The project demonstrates the application of artificial intelligence in computer vision and pattern recognition.</p>

            <h3><a href="p4.html"  class="Name">Student Marketplace</a></h3>
            <p>A dedicated online marketplace for students to buy and sell educational resources such as textbooks, stationery, and other learning materials. The platform ensures a secure and relevant trading environment by implementing restrictions on product types and user registrations. It features an enhanced search functionality to help students quickly find specific products, along with a user-friendly interface for seamless transactions. The goal is to create a cost-effective and convenient solution that simplifies the exchange of educational resources among students. </p>
